Portfolio Management for Polymarket Wallets

Users can input Polymarket wallets and see the trades that they've done, see the exposure to different sectors, map that over time, see information like the expected value of your portfolio, when all your contracts are going to get resolved on some sort of calendar, just overall a dashboard to see everything you would need about your current portfolio status, which is really helpful.
